## Introduction

Swing traders hold positions over several days and sometimes for a few weeks.

Swing trading won't turn you into an overnight millionaire. Period. Anyone who tells you different is either lying, doesn’t know, or has something to sell you.

As a beginner you will likely lose money. There are few teachers better than the pain of losing money.

As you improve, you can expect to achieve investment performance in-line with the overall market and possibly above it. If you reach an advanced level of swing trading, then you may be able to generate 15 to 20 percent annually over time.

Topics covered:

- Your trading plan: Have a real, detailed plan of your strategy.
- Popular chart patterns to trade: Focus on the tried-and-true chart patterns.
- Fundamentals: It’s essential to find out the basics of the assets and apply the most important measures in your trading.
- Investment returns: Learn how to calculate and measure your returns so you know if you're doing better than the overall market.
- The importance of a journal: Keep track and avoid repeating mistakes.
- Risk: How to manage your portfolio’s risk. **even if you get everything wrong except your risk management, you can still make a profit.**

## Ch1. Swing Trading from A to Z

The most common way to earn a living is by mastering some skill and exchanging your time for money. The more skilled you are, the higher your compensation.

The upside of mastering a skill is clear: You’re relatively safe with regard to income. But there are no guarantees: Your skill may become outdated, or your job may be shipped overseas. You also have a maximum earning potential given the maximum hours you can work.

Swing trading offers you the prospect of earning income based not on the hours you put in but on the quality of your trades.

**Swing trading takes advantage of short-term price movements**

### Understanding What Swing Trading Is (and Isn’t)

Swing trading is the art and science of profiting from securities’ short-term price movements spanning a few days to a few weeks. Can be individuals or institutions. They’re rarely 100 percent invested in the market at any time. Generally, large institutional investors can't swing trade because their size prohibits them from easily moving in and out of a position.

Swing trading is different from day trading or buy-and-hold investing. Those types of investors approach the markets differently, trade at different frequencies, and pay attention to different data sources.

### The differences between swing trading and buy-and-hold investing

If you’re a buy-and-hold investor in the mold of Warren Buffett, you care little for price swings. Short-term price movements are merely opportunities to pick up securities (or exit them) at prices not reflective of their true value.

Buy-and-hold investing is an admirable practice, it’s not as time-intensive as swing trading and not as difficult. But if you have the work ethic, discipline, and interest in swing trading, you can:

- Generate an income stream
- Time your buys and sells and hold a basket of positions to diversify your risk
- Achieve lower drawdowns than buy-and-hold investing: During market crashes, buy-and-hold investors can experience drawdowns of 50 percent or more in their portfolios. Swing traders, on the other hand, are only in the market when there is opportunity.

### The differences between swing trading and day trading

Day traders monitor price movements on a minute-by-minute basis and time entries and exits that span hours. Short-term price movements can be driven by a major seller or buyer in the market and not by a company’s fundamentals. Day traders often rack up major commission charges, which makes it that much more difficult to beat the overall market.

### What Swing Trading Is to You: Determining Your Time Commitment

First, you need to think about what kind of swing trader you want to be.

Your first step is to determine just how much time you can commit to swing trading. The point is you need to make adjustments depending on whether you’re able to watch the market all day. And by the way, watching the market all day long doesn’t necessarily improve your returns.

### Swing trading as your primary source of income

Swing traders who trade full time devote several hours a day to trading. They research possible trades before, during, and after market hours. And they handle pressure well.

Many traders find that they can’t handle the stress of trading full time.

**The correct response to a series of losses isn’t more trading but less trading.** Take a step back and evaluate the situation.

Swing trading requires an incredible amount of self-restraint, discipline, and calm. A swing trader who trades for income must always be unemotional.

Don’t quit your day job just because you generate impressive profits for a few months:

If you plan on living off of $5,000 per month, for example, you can’t expect to generate that kind of profit on $30,000 of capital. That would require a monthly gain of 16.67 percent! Some of the best all-time traders in the world topped out at returns of 20 to 25 percent annually over 20 or 30 years.

### Sneaking a Peek at the Swing Trader’s Strategic Plan

Countless clichés address the importance of a trading plan. Without the plan, you’re likely to fall into the trap of making things up as you go. Your trading will be erratic. You won’t improve because you won’t have the records on your past trading.

### The “what”: Determining which securities you’ll trade

Three most common instruments I recommend you trade:

- Public equity (stock)
- Exchange traded funds (ETFs)
- American Depository Receipts (ADRs) bleh

### The “where”: Deciding where you’ll trade

For me this means, which CEX or DEX or group of them will I use.

### The “when” and the “how”: Choosing your trading style and strategy

- Part-time swing traders enter orders when markets are closed and rely on limit and stop losses to execute this strategy.
- Full-time traders, on the other hand, can execute their entries and exits during the day and incorporate intraday price action

Swing traders rely on two major analysis techniques: technical analysis and fundamental analysis.

Most swing traders rely solely or in large measure on technical analysis. However, I explain both because I strongly believe that understanding and using both improves the odds of success.

Just how much should you care about a company’s fundamentals? The general rule of thumb is that the longer your investment horizon, the more important fundamental analysis becomes. The shorter your horizon, the less important fundamental analysis is in trading securities. This is because short-term movements are driven by momentum, noise, and other factors. Over the long term, however, fundamentals always win out.

**Just because you understand how to apply fundamentals doesn’t mean you’ll make money. Markets can remain under- or overvalued for long periods of time.**

Fundamental analysis tells you which way the wind is blowing so you’re prepared, but technical analysis provides the important timing components.

### Plan your exit

Most swing traders focus almost entirely on their entry strategy, but it’s the exit strategy that determines when you take profits, when you take losses, and when you exit a meandering position so you can put the capital to better use. So although planning your entry is important, you need to spend equal (if not more) time on your exit.

### Preparing your risk management plan

A trading plan with a weak entry strategy and a weak exit strategy can still be profitable if the risk management strategy limits losses and lets profits run.

The preceding bullets all boil down to two categories of action: position sizing and limiting losses at the portfolio level. So what’s the difference between the two? Alexander Elder, a trading expert, once differentiated between losses suffered at the individual stock level and the portfolio level through an analogy of sharks and fish. Specifically, he said that position sizing is done to reduce the risk that your portfolio will suffer a “shark bite” loss from a single position. That is, a single major loss that wipes out your account value.

On the other hand, portfolio risk management is done to prevent several small losses from killing you — or as he described it, death by piranha bites. A single small piranha may not be able to kill a larger mammal, but dozens of piranha working together can be deadly.

Similarly, a small loss is not life threatening for a portfolio. The risk is that several small losses may gang up and cause major loss. That’s why you must limit losses on an individual stock level (and avoid those shark bites) while also limiting losses on the portfolio level (to prevent death by piranha bites).

### Building Your Swing Trading Prowess

- Be a student of the markets
- Try to insulate yourself as much as possible from others’ opinions, whether the person is an Average Joe or a Wall Street analyst
- Admit to losses when they occur
- Don’t look for guidance or data from Twitter, Reddit, or message boards

## Ch2. Understanding the Swing Trader’s Two Main Strategies

### **Chapter 2 Summary: Understanding the Swing Trader’s Two Main Strategies**

#### **Overview**

This chapter explores the **two primary strategies** that swing traders use—**technical analysis** and **fundamental analysis**—as well as the **two trading styles**: **discretionary trading** and **quantitative trading**. The goal is to help traders understand different approaches, choose what aligns with their strengths, and maximize their success.

---

## **Two Main Strategies in Swing Trading**

### **1. Technical Analysis**

Technical analysis focuses on **price movements and volume** rather than company fundamentals. Swing traders using this approach rely on **charts, trends, and technical indicators** to identify **entry and exit points**.

- **Advantages of Technical Analysis:**

  - Works well for short-term trading (days or weeks).
  - Eliminates the need for deep company research.
  - Less subjective—traders tend to agree on chart patterns.
  - Requires less time and effort compared to fundamental analysis.

- **Best for:** Traders with short time frames who want to **react quickly** to price movements.

### **2. Fundamental Analysis**

Fundamental analysis examines a company’s **assets, earnings, liabilities, industry position, and economic catalysts** to assess its value.

- **Types of Fundamental Analysis:**

  - **Growth Stocks:** Companies expected to grow quickly.
  - **Value Stocks:** Stocks that appear undervalued compared to competitors.
  - **Event-Driven Trading:** Swing traders look for events that may influence stock prices, such as earnings reports, new product launches, or industry changes.

- **Advantages of Fundamental Analysis:**

  - Helps traders understand **why** a stock moves.
  - Can be combined with technical analysis for better decision-making.
  - Identifies **longer-term trends** that may drive price action.

- **Best for:** Traders who want a deeper understanding of **market trends and catalysts**.

> **Tip:** The most effective swing traders combine **both** technical and fundamental analysis to confirm trades.

---

## **Two Trading Styles: Discretionary vs. Quantitative**

### **1. Discretionary Trading**

Discretionary traders make trade decisions **manually**, based on **experience, rules, and intuition**. They use technical and/or fundamental analysis but retain **flexibility** in execution.

- **Advantages:**

  - Can adapt to changing market conditions.
  - Allows traders to override signals based on external factors.
  - Suitable for traders who enjoy evaluating each trade individually.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Prone to **emotional biases** (e.g., holding onto losing trades).
  - Requires constant **monitoring** and decision-making.

> **Best for:** Traders who prefer **hands-on decision-making** and want flexibility.

### **2. Quantitative (Systematic) Trading**

Quantitative traders develop **computer algorithms** that automatically execute trades based on predefined rules.

- **Advantages:**

  - Eliminates **emotional decision-making**.
  - Can process large amounts of data quickly.
  - Based on **historical backtesting** and probability.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Market conditions change—what worked in the past may not work in the future.
  - Requires **programming skills** and experience in data modeling.
  - May not capture unexpected external factors.

> **Best for:** Traders comfortable with **automation, data analysis, and algorithmic execution**.

---

## **Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Approach**

Regardless of the strategy, swing traders can **analyze markets in two ways**:

1. **Top-Down Approach:** Starts at a **macro level** (economy, sectors) and drills down to **individual stocks**.
2. **Bottom-Up Approach:** Starts with **individual companies** and analyzes their broader industry and economic conditions.

- **Both approaches** can be used in technical or fundamental analysis.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Technical analysis** is best for short-term trades and relies on **charts and indicators**.
2. **Fundamental analysis** examines a company's financials, **industry trends, and catalysts**.
3. **Discretionary traders** manually evaluate each trade and adapt based on experience.
4. **Quantitative traders** use **automated algorithms** to execute trades systematically.
5. **Both approaches** (technical & fundamental) can be used together for **better results**.
6. **Choosing the right style** depends on your **skills, preferences, and goals**.

> **Final Advice:** The most successful swing traders leverage **both technical and fundamental analysis** to make informed trading decisions. However, choosing between discretionary and quantitative trading depends on your **comfort level with automation and data analysis**.

### **Summary of the Rest of Chapter 2: Understanding the Swing Trader’s Two Main Strategies**

## **Technical Analysis: Theory, Strengths, and Weaknesses**

### **Understanding Technical Theory**

Technical analysis is the practice of interpreting **price charts and trading volume** to predict future price movements. It ranges from simple **chart pattern recognition** to complex **technical indicators and intermarket analysis**.

Key questions technical analysts ask:

- Is the security in a **bull or bear market**?
- Is it **trending or range-bound**?
- Are **buyers or sellers in control**?
- Are the strength levels of buyers/sellers **increasing or weakening**?
- What **price level signals a reversal or failure**?
- When should one **enter or exit** the trade?

### **Why Technical Analysis Works**

Technical analysis is based on **crowd psychology** and **market memory**:

1. **Traders React Similarly to News** – Investors share emotions like greed, fear, and hope, which impact price patterns.
2. **Market Memory Creates Key Price Levels** – Traders tend to buy and sell at psychologically significant levels (e.g., round numbers).
3. **Smart Money vs. Dumb Money** – Institutional investors (smart money) influence price movements, while amateur traders (dumb money) may act irrationally.

> **Tip:** Avoid placing sell orders at round numbers (e.g., $100) because many traders do the same, causing resistance. Instead, use non-obvious levels (e.g., $98.71).

### **Pros and Cons of Technical Analysis**

**Pros:**

- Works across all markets and timeframes.
- Provides **clear entry and exit points**.
- Useful in new markets (e.g., **cryptocurrency**).
- Accounts for **market psychology**.
- Less subjective than fundamental analysis.

**Cons:**

- Ignores a **security’s intrinsic value**.
- Can mislead traders if price moves **irrationally**.
- Assumes the market is always right.
- May generate **false signals**.

> **Warning:** Technical analysis is not an exact science. Traders must manage uncertainty and avoid emotional biases.

### **Is Technical Analysis Valid?**

- **Academics often reject** technical analysis, arguing that past price movements **don’t predict future trends**.
- Some **respected finance experts** (e.g., Andrew Lo from MIT) support technical indicators for trading.
- Many **hedge funds and professional traders** use technical analysis to time their trades.

> **Conclusion:** Technical analysis **works best** when combined with **support and resistance levels**, **volume analysis**, and **trend confirmation**.

---

## **Fundamental Analysis: Theory, Strengths, and Weaknesses**

### **What is Fundamental Analysis?**

Fundamental analysis examines a company’s **intrinsic value** by assessing:

- **Industry trends** and competition.
- **Catalysts** that could drive stock prices up or down.
- **Financial ratios** like earnings and debt levels.
- **Market expectations vs. actual earnings performance**.

Fundamental analysts ask:

- What **factors affect the company’s industry**?
- What **catalysts** will influence share prices?
- How does this company compare to its **peers**?
- What does the market **expect**, and how will actual performance compare?
- What are the **returns on capital and debt levels**?

> **Tip:** Swing traders don’t need an MBA-level understanding of fundamentals. A high-level overview of key factors is enough.

### **Why Fundamental Analysis Works**

1. **Higher earnings lead to higher valuations** – Investors pay more for companies with growing profits.
2. **Arbitrageurs exploit mispricings** – If a company’s **market value** is below its **intrinsic value**, traders step in and push prices higher.

### **Pros and Cons of Fundamental Analysis**

**Pros:**

- Helps traders understand **industry trends** and **competitive advantages**.
- Can identify **long-term winners**.
- Works best for **event-driven trading** (e.g., earnings reports, mergers).

**Cons:**

- **Takes time** to analyze companies.
- **Harder to apply across different markets** (e.g., real estate vs. tech stocks).
- **Market prices may not reflect value for months or years**.
- **More subjective** than technical analysis.

> **Warning:** Avoid using fundamental analysis for **timing exits** unless it’s an **event-driven** situation (e.g., earnings report, government policy change). Instead, use **technical analysis for exits**.

---

## **Catalysts and Growth vs. Value Investing**

### **Understanding Catalysts**

A **catalyst** is an event that **triggers a stock price movement**. Swing traders use catalysts to **time their trades**.

#### **Types of Catalysts**

1. **Internal Catalysts** – Company-specific changes, such as:
   - **New products/services** (e.g., Apple’s iPhone launch).
   - **Leadership changes** (e.g., a new CEO driving a turnaround).
2. **External Catalysts** – Industry-wide or macroeconomic events, such as:
   - **Mergers & Acquisitions** (e.g., a competitor gets acquired).
   - **Commodity price changes** (e.g., rising oil prices affecting energy stocks).

> **Example:** Bitcoin’s 2017 boom (+1400%) boosted Nvidia stock (+82%) because **crypto miners needed powerful graphics cards**.

### **Growth vs. Value Stocks**

- **Growth Stocks** – Trade at **higher valuations** and are expected to grow rapidly (e.g., tech and biotech firms).
- **Value Stocks** – Trade at **discounted valuations**, often in stable industries (e.g., utilities, consumer staples).

Swing traders should **pay attention to market cycles**, as growth and value stocks **outperform at different times**.

> **Tip:** Instead of forecasting which will outperform, **use technical analysis to confirm the trend**.

---

## **Final Takeaways**

1. **Technical Analysis** is ideal for short-term trades. It identifies **trend direction, support/resistance, and momentum**.
2. **Fundamental Analysis** helps traders understand **why stocks move** and identifies catalysts.
3. **Catalysts** provide **timing opportunities** in event-driven trading.
4. **Growth and Value Stocks** alternate in leadership—use **technical signals** to trade the dominant group.
5. **Swing traders can use both fundamental and technical analysis** to make informed decisions.

> **Conclusion:** The most successful traders combine **both technical and fundamental analysis** while aligning their strategy with their personal strengths and market conditions.

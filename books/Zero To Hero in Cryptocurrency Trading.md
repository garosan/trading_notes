## Ch1. Introduction to Cryptocurrency Trading

I truly believe that any reader who puts in the work will achieve a measurable degree of success.

You need to understand how the market works, how you can identify a way to beat it, and how you can test and automate a system that does that day and night.

Myths:

- I will find a successful strategy on YouTube
- I will make money paying for trading signals
- I will run a successful trading bot
- I will successfully invest in copy-trading platforms

Futures (what we will use in this book)


When we open a position that we expect to rise in value, we do it by opening a long position.
When we open a position that we expect to fall in value, we open a short position.

When we issue a long order, the CEX buys the token for our account and now we have that token in our CEX account.

When we open a short position at market value, what the CEX actually does is buy the token, and then instantly sell it at the price it bought it. When we close the short, the CEX rebuys the token at the new price, and we get the difference.

## Introduction

After the stock market crash of the 2000s, 2008 and then again with COVID, investors seriously reconsidered the 'buy and hold forever' mantra. The ones with more appetite for risk became traders. This book focuses on position trading, as opposed to day trading or swing trading.

## Ch1. The Ups and Downs of Trading Stocks

Success as a trader depends on how well you use the tools, gather the needed information and interpret the data you have. **You need to develop discipline.** 

You need to avoid getting caught in emotional aspects. Trading is a business. You need to set goals, research options, plan and implement strategies and assess results.

### Trading vs Investing

Investors buy stocks and hold them for a long time. 

Normally investors with agressive portfolios expect a 12% anual return over a 20-year period. These investors generally have a 10-year or more investment horizon.

Investors who need cash flow (generally older people) regularly have most of their portfolio in bonds and expect a 5% anual return.

As a trader, you look for the best option for your money and **set a goal of exceeding what an investor can otherwise make on an aggressive portfolio.**

### Seeing Why Traders Do What They Do

People who decide to trade make a conscious decision to take a more active role in increasing their profit potential.

### Successful Trading Characteristics

You need to ignore emotional ties to any stock. You need to learn to accept that you will mistakes and not always be right.

### Tools of the Trade

Traders' favorite charting software: StockCharts and TradeStation will be reviewed.

### Types of Traders

- *Position traders* hold positions for a few days up to a year or more.
- *Swing traders* generally hold stocks for a few days.
- *Day traders* enter and exit positions in hours, minutes or seconds but never leave a position open overnight.

### Going Long or Short

Before starting, you need to:

- Know which stocks you want to buy and hold.
- Know at what price you want to enter and at what price you want to exit.

You can even make money buying and selling *options* on stocks. A *call option* enables you to simulate a long position, while a *put option* enables you to simulate a short position. However, with options, you're never guaranteed to make money. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter 19.

### Managing your money

*The key is knowing when to hold and when to fold.*

If your position in a stock is producing a profit, you can periodically raise your target exit price to ensure you keep most of that profit.

Understand your risks: *market risks, investment risks, trading risks*.

### Understanding Fundamental Analysis

Understanding the basics of the business cycle can help you improve at trading.

You will learn how to identify economic growth and recession periods and how these impact bull and bear markets.

You will learn about *sector rotation*.

**You will learn about how money supply, inflation rates, deflation, unemployment and consumer confidence impact the mood of the market and how the economy can be driven by how political and monetary leaders speak out about it. We will discuss the role of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Fed Chairman.**

You never should depend entirely on what analysts say, you should do your own research and collect opinions.

## Technical Analysis

After choosing your target stocks, you *then* use technical analysis to follow trends in the prices of the target stocks so you know the best time to get in and out of a stock position.

Your 1st step is finding out how to create a chart. The most popular is bar charting.

Chapter 10 is about support and resistance.

Chapter 11 is about moving averages and how to use them to identify trends. You will also learn about oscillators and other indicators like the MACD indicator or the stochastic oscillator.

You'll learn the concept of *relative strength*

## Putting Trading Strategy into Practice

So the recipe would be something like:

- Determine which part of the economic cycle is driving the market
- Determine which sector makes the most sense for trading
- Figure out which sectors are best positioned to go up
- Find out which stocks are leading those sectors
- Evaluate which potential moves by the Fed can impact the strength of the market
- Evaluate other macro-economic factors that may impact the markets

Once fundamental analysis is completed, start technical analysis:

- Trade within overall technical conditions
- Confirm which economic cycle we're in using index charts
- Determine whether a sector is in a range or entering a trend
- Determine which leading stocks are stuck in ranges or ready to break into a trend

Finally learn to manage risk by setting up stop-loss positions and choosing a time frame.

Chapter 14 is about ETFs.

Finally you'll learn to develop your own trading system:

- Design and keep a trading log
- Identify reliable trading patterns
- Develop an exit strategy
- Determine whether you'll use discretionary(?) trading methods or mechanical(?) trading (manual vs automated?)
- Decide whether to develop your own system or buy one
- Test out your trading system before going all in

Finally assess your results and fix any problems.

## Trading at Higher Risk

Part 5 (Chapters 17-20) are all about swing trading, day trading and trading derivatives and foreign currency.

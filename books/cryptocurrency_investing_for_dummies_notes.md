## Ch1. What Is a Cryptocurrency?

Diferencia entre una criptomoneda y una moneda digital regular.

Problemas con los sistemas de dinero actuales:

- Payments systems are outdated
- Bunch of intermediaries take a cut, making transactions expensive and slow
- Financial inequality is growing
- Threat of confiscation of your assets
- 3 billion unbanked or underbanked people can't access financial services

The definition of money

To be valuable, money must have these characteristics:

- Enough people must have it
- Merchants must accept it
- Society must trust that it's valuable and will remain so in the future

What is _fiat money_? Legal tender like coins and banknotes that have value only because the government says so.

## Ch2. Why Invest in Cryptocurrencies?

Diversifying from traditional investments

The cryptocurrency industry is vastly different from traditional ones. One of the main reasons for this higher potential is that the cryptocurrency market may react differently to various geopolitical and financial events.

A brief description of

- Stocks
- Bonds (fixed-income securities)
- FOREX
- Precious metals

## Crypto dividends

- HODLing
- Staking

M√°s explicaciones sobre las posibles ventajas de las criptomonedas

## Ch3. Recognizing the Risks of Cryptocurrencies

3 ways to multiply your money by compounding:

- Buy low sell high
- Reinvest dividends or interest
- Regular contributions

**The lowest risk, highest return investment is always an investment in yourself to learn a high-income creating skill.**

Build your emergency fund first

Diversify outside and inside your cryptocurrency portfolio

## Ch4. Looking Under the Hood: Blockchain Technology

### Blockchain Tech basics

No tiene caso sacar esta info de un libro enfocado en inversiones.

Issues with blockchain:

- Scalability problems
- Environmental problems
- Fraud problems

## Ch5. How Cryptocurrencies Work

Topics covered:

- Basics of how cryptocurrencies function
- Basic cryptocurrency terminology
- Explaining forks

Just a very brief description of:

- Cryptography: Hashing, symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Nodes
- Mining
- Proof-Of-Work
- Proof-Of-Stake
- Other Proof-Of algorithms
- Transactions
- Smart contracts

Nothing really relevant at this point.

## Ch6: How to Buy Cryptocurrencies

TLDR: Really just pick an exchange and buy. Makes no sense to use a broker like Robinhood, eToro or Interactive Brokers IMHO.

## Ch7: Using Cryptocurrency Wallets

Terms:

- Hot wallet: A wallet connected to the internet.
- Cold wallet: A wallet not connected to the internet.

_There's a very low chance that somebody else can get your funds by mistake_ Lol.

Online wallets may be less secure, but they do have a bunch of advantages for small amounts of cryptocurrencies.

## Ch8: Different Types of Cryptocurrencies

The info in this chapter is super outdated or super irrelevant.

## Ch9: Identifying Top Performing Cryptocurrencies

Investment Diva Diamond Analysis (IDDA) framework:

- Intentional Analysis
- Capital Analysis (personal risk management)
- Fundamental analysis
- Technical analysis
- Sentimental (market risk) analysis

For sentimental analysis:

## Ch10: Diversification in Cryptocurrencies

Don't diversify just for the sake of it without knowing what you're investing on.

- Unsystematic risk:
  - Business risk
  - Country risk
  - Default risk
  - Executive risk
- Systematic risk:
  - Market risk
  - Exchange rate risk
  - Interest rate risk
  - Event risk

Not much to say here either.
